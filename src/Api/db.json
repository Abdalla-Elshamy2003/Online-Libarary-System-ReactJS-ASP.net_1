        "description": "An introduction to fundamental theories of concurrent computation and associated programming languages for developing distributed and mobile computing systems. Starting from the premise that understanding the foundations of concurrent programming is key to developing distributed computing systems, this book first presents the fundamental theories of concurrent computing and then introduces the programming languages that help develop distributed computing systems at a high level of abstraction. The major theories of concurrent computation—including the π-calculus, the actor model, the join calculus, and mobile ambients—are explained with a focus on how they help design and reason about distributed and mobile computing systems. The book then presents programming languages that follow the theoretical models already described, including Pict, SALSA, and JoCaml. The parallel structure of the chapters in both part one (theory) and part two (practice) enable the reader not only to compare the different theories but also to see clearly how a programming language supports a theoretical model. The book is unique in bridging the gap between the theory and the practice of programming distributed computing systems. It can be used as a textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in computer science or as a reference for researchers in the area of programming technology for distributed computing. By presenting theory first, the book allows readers to focus on the essential components of concurrency, distribution, and mobility without getting bogged down in syntactic details of specific programming languages. Once the theory is understood, the practical part of implementing a system in an actual programming language becomes much easier.",

        "description": "Family-owned businesses are among the most notable and numerous in the world. Some are global brands employing thousands – think Walmart, Ford and JCB – others are much smaller, more local enterprises run by their owners and staffed entirely by their family. But however big or small, running or working in a family business, and the bringing together of two conflicting and complex worlds – family and business – often presents very unique challenges for everyone involved, be they part of the family or employees and advisors. The Family Business Book draws on Paul Keogh’s expertise and decades of work with family businesses of all sizes, all around the world, to help their owners, family members and employees feel informed, empowered and equipped to make the right decisions and navigate the ups and downs, successes and disappointments. Easy to read and packed with top tips, discover essential and honest guidance on: Juggling the demands of work with the expectations of family. Handling conflict and rivalries whilst dealing with intricate family dynamics. Putting effective communication at the heart of both worlds. Building clear structures and establishing sensible governance. Making critical decisions and managing change – in the family and the business! Talking about money and planning for succession. Functioning better as a family is the key to a better functioning family business, so from divorce to death, and deceit to desertion, this book never shies away from asking the difficult questions and discussing the complicated issues that families in business face to make sure both their worlds survive and thrive.",

        "description": "How the theoretical tools of literacy help us understand programming in its historical, social and conceptual contexts. The message from educators, the tech community, and even politicians is clear: everyone should learn to code. To emphasize the universality and importance of computer programming, promoters of coding for everyone often invoke the concept of “literacy,” drawing parallels between reading and writing code and reading and writing text. In this book, Annette Vee examines the coding-as-literacy analogy and argues that it can be an apt rhetorical frame. The theoretical tools of literacy help us understand programming beyond a technical level, and in its historical, social, and conceptual contexts. Viewing programming from the perspective of literacy and literacy from the perspective of programming, she argues, shifts our understandings of both. Computer programming becomes part of an array of communication skills important in everyday life, and literacy, augmented by programming, becomes more capacious. Vee examines the ways that programming is linked with literacy in coding literacy campaigns, considering the ideologies that accompany this coupling, and she looks at how both writing and programming encode and distribute information. She explores historical parallels between writing and programming, using the evolution of mass textual literacy to shed light on the trajectory of code from military and government infrastructure to large-scale businesses to personal use. Writing and coding were institutionalized, domesticated, and then established as a basis for literacy. Just as societies demonstrated a “literate mentality” regardless of the literate status of individuals, Vee argues, a “computational mentality” is now emerging even though coding is still a specialized skill.",

RNS-RD is comprised of a team of nurses with over thirty years experience in vastly different specialty areas in health care: business, research, clinical and managed care, to name a few. RNS-RD seeks to empower clinicians from all areas of health care to dominate and take charge of their career through collaboration and entrepreneurship. RNS-RD is not a consulting firm. We do not offer courses or seminars. RNS-RD offers easy- to-read, easy-to-comprehend step-by-step DIY (do it yourself) guidelines on how to start and operate a profitable, manageable nurse staffing agency. Why DIY? DIY guidelines are economical and drive the business owners to learn the process. According to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 20 percent of US small businesses fail within the first year. By the end of their fifth year, roughly 50 percent have faltered. This is partly because new business owners are not studying and taking the time to truly learn their market. If you are thinking about becoming a nurse staff agency owner, let RNS-RD help you jump- start your plan!",

The authors lay out a proven strategy that forces the reader to plan as their software project unfolds, and therefore avoid many of the nasty problems that can potentially spring up along the way.",

        "description": "Why should you go to the trouble of creating a written business plan? There are three major reasons: The process of putting a business plan together, including the thought you put in before beginning to write it, forces you to take an objective, critical unemotional look at your business project in its entirety. The finished product your business plan is and operating told which, properly used, will help you manage your business and work toward its success. The completed business plan is the means for communicating your ideas to others and provide the basis for your financing proposal. The importance of planning cannot be overemphasized. By taking an objective look at your business you can identify areas of weakness and strengths, pinpoint needs you might otherwise overlook, spot problems before they arise, and begin planning how you can best achieve your business goals. As an operating tool, your business plan helps you to establish reasonable objectives and figure out how to best accomplish them. It also helps you to red-flag problems as they arise and aids you to identifying their sources, thus suggesting ways to solve them. It may even help you avoid some problems altogether. This handbook has been designed with these considerations in mind. In order for it to work it is important that you do as much of the work as possible. A professionally prepared business plan wont do you any good if you dont understand it thoroughly. This understanding comes from being involved with its development from the very start. No business plan, no matter how carefully constructed and no matter how thoroughly understood, will be of any use at all unless you use it. Going into business is rough; over half of all new businesses fail within the first two years of operation and over 90 percent fail within the first 10 years. A major reason for failure is lack of planning. The best way to enhance your chances of success is to plan and follow through on your planning. Use your plan. Dont put it in the bottom drawer of your desk and forget it. Your business plan can help you avoid going into a business venture that is doomed to failure. If your proposed venture is marginal at best, the business plan will show you why and may help you avoid paying the high tuition of business failure. It is far cheaper not to begin an ill-fated business than to learn by experience what your business plan could have taught you at several hours of concentrated work. Finally, your business plan provides the information needed by others to evaluate your venture, especially if you need to seek outside financing. A thorough business automatically becomes a complete financing proposal which will meet the requirements of most lenders.",

        "description": "The world of sales and marketing has transformed dramatically in just the past few months! Technology is the clay from which marketing programs are formed. Professionals have an intimate relationship with that technology, always keeping a high-powered computer their pockets and purses. Knowing precisely how to leverage the power of that technology--right now--can make or break a small or mid-sized business. Knowing how to leverage the power of relationships is part of that scenario. The owners of Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, and other mega-companies now rank among the richest persons in the world. That's because their services provide sellers with extraordinary reach and buyers with exceptional convenience. People buy feelings, not things. What you make motivates buyers less than how your product makes them feel. A Guide to Growing Your Business addresses these issues of choice, motivation, and more with practical steps to convert a vision into the business you promised your customers, investors, family, and yourself. If you have aggressive growth plans, serious sales goals and lots at stake, this is the handbook for you. The authors are a powerhouse team of business expertise. Bill Hughes has more than forty years of professional sales, marketing and business management experience. He has held executive level positions with large and small companies. Since 1990, he has worked with 50 plus small-to-medium-size companies to increase revenues, profits and corporate valuation through time-efficient, innovative business strategies, coupled with results-driven sales and marketing programs. He has been a guest lecturer at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey and National University in San Diego, California. Co-author Aastha Verma is a senior cyber security expert for the United States Government and holds degree in electrical engineering and system engineering. Co-author Michael Hughes is a veteran in the digital marketing field and helped thousands of businesses increase sales and realize profitable returns from their online marketing investments.",

        "description": "The popular C# programming language combines the high productivity of rapid application development languages with the raw power of C and C++. Updated to cover the new features of C# 4.0, including dynamic binding, named and optional parameters, and covariant and contravariant generic types, this release takes the language to the next level by adding the ability to cleanly write programs that don’t rely on static type definitions. This allows dynamic programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to feel native to C#. The C# Programming Language, Fourth Edition, continues to be the authoritative and annotated technical reference for C# 4.0. 7nbsp; Written by Anders Hejlsberg, the language’s architect, and his colleagues, Mads Torgersen, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde, this volume has been completely updated for C# 4.0. The book provides the complete specification of the language, along with descriptions, reference materials, code samples, and annotations from twelve prominent C# gurus. The many annotations bring a depth and breadth of understanding rarely found in any programming book. As the main text of the book introduces the concepts of the C# language, cogent annotations explain why they are important, how they are used, how they relate to other languages, and even how they evolved. This book is the definitive, must-have reference for any developer who wants to understand C#. With annotations from: Brad Abrams, Joseph Albahari, Krzysztof Cwalina, Jesse Liberty, Eric Lippert, Christian Nagel, Vladimir Reshetnikov, Marek Safar, Chris Sells, Peter Sestoft, Jon Skeet, and Bill Wagner.",

What You Will Learn Get to know the difference between imperative and functional approaches See the use of first-class functions and pure functions in a functional style Discover various techniques to apply immutable state to avoid side effects Design a recursive algorithm effectively Create faster programs using lazy evaluation Structure code using design patterns to make the design process easier Use concurrency techniques to develop responsive software Learn how to use the C++ Standard Template Library and metaprogramming in a functional way to improve code optimization In Detail Functional programming allows developers to divide programs into smaller, reusable components that ease the creation, testing, and maintenance of software as a whole. Combined with the power of C++, you can develop robust and scalable applications that fulfill modern day software requirements. This book will help you discover all the C++ 17 features that can be applied to build software in a functional way. The book is divided into three modules—the first introduces the fundamentals of functional programming and how it is supported by modern C++. The second module explains how to efficiently implement C++ features such as pure functions and immutable states to build robust applications. The last module describes how to achieve concurrency and apply design patterns to enhance your application's performance. Here, you will also learn to optimize code using metaprogramming in a functional way. By the end of the book, you will be familiar with the functional approach of programming and will be able to use these techniques on a daily basis. Style and approach This book uses a module-based approach, where each module will cover important aspects of functional programming in C++ and will help you develop efficient and robust applications through gaining a practical understanding.",

        "description": "Computer programming is a skill that can bring great enjoyment from the creativity involved in designing and implementing a solution to a problem. This classroom-tested and easy-to-follow textbook teaches the reader how to program using Python, an accessible language which can be learned incrementally. Through an extensive use of examples and practical exercises, students will learn to recognize and apply abstract patterns in programming, as well as how to inspect the state of a program using a debugger tool. Features: contains numerous examples and solved practice exercises designed for an interactive classroom environment; highlights several patterns which commonly appear in programs, and presents exercises that reinforce recognition and application of these patterns; introduces the use of a debugger, and includes supporting material that reveals how programs work; presents the Tkinter framework for building graphical user interface applications and event-driven programs; provides helpful additional resources for instructors at the associated website: http://cs.luther.edu/~leekent/CS1. This hands-on textbook for active learning in the classroom will enable undergraduates in computer science to develop the necessary skills to begin developing their own programs. It employs Python as the introductory language due to the wealth of support available for programmers.",
